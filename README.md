This is a simple paint app that was written using React and styled using Bootstrap. The app allows users to draw on a canvas using their choice of color, brush size, and opacity. Users can also clear the canvas and save their drawings as images.

To run the project, clone the repository and run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
